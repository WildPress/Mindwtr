## Review loop from v1.3.0 — September 22, 2026

Planned against `59d0e575e` (public docs `89ac579b`). GPT-6 Astra reviewed all nine improve categories; GPT-5.6 Sol implements the selected findings. Automatic selection under review-improve-loop includes all three high-confidence actionable plans. The comprehensive fixes are separate commits; their evidence is in the local task report. Existing plan128 is an unrelated native experiment and is preserved.

| Plan | Finding | Priority | Effort | Dependencies | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [129](129-authenticated-developer-examples.md) | DOCS-01: developer examples omit required authentication | P3 | S | None | DONE (web183b164e) |
| [130](130-cloud-quick-add-capture-parity.md) | CORRECTNESS-01: Cloud quick-add drops project/date capture metadata | P2 | S | None | DONE (8dd02f92f) |
| [131](131-widget-shared-focus-pools.md) | ARCH-01: widget duplicates core Focus pool policy through an obsolete adapter | P3 | S | None | DONE (6e3eff2ee) |

Plans may run independently in isolated worktrees. Plan129 changes only the public-doc repository;130 reuses core capture inside the existing single Cloud write;131 is the sole additional Strong architecture candidate, deleting the obsolete adapter and duplicate policy. AUTO-04 already handles the CLI capture deepening, so it is not a second architecture refactor. Root maintains status and creates one commit per finding.

Considered and rejected: PWA port drift (5173 matches), Core API tombstone visibility mismatch (visible versus all collections are intentional), new CI/dependency restructuring, generic retry/notification/controller frameworks, size-only module splits, new caches, and reopening ADR0029 native/merge scheduling direction without new measurements. Existing image-size build-input advisories and quick-xml/rkyv dependency deferrals remain; current locked-manifest checks and configured Rust audit gate pass. No additional supported security or performance defect was established. Physical-device/background/signing limits remain explicit in the result.

## Review loop from v1.3.0 — September 18, 2026

Planned against `561cfdfa0` (integration branch `agent/integrate-20260918` = main `8fe8c9293` + the phase-1 review fixes and their closure corrections). Phase-1 findings were fixed directly (see `.orchestrator/tasks/impl-20260918/LEDGER.md`, not tracked). This is the phase-2 improve set, selected by default (non-interactive run): every high-confidence actionable finding of the three audits. Plan 116 targets the public docs repository.

| Plan | Finding | Priority | Effort | Dependencies | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [111](111-clear-trash-purges-only-what-is-shown.md) | PROD-02: Clear Trash deletes items the screen does not show | P1 | S | None | DONE |

| [116](116-user-guide-matches-1-3-1-screens.md) | DOCS-01: public guide describes the pre-1.3.1 screens (six languages) | P3 | M | 113 (one sentence) | DONE |
| [117](117-ai-endpoint-stays-on-device.md) | SEC-02: a synced settings document can choose where the AI API key is sent | P0 | S | None | DONE |

| [119](119-server-rejected-attachment-is-terminal.md) | REL-03: a file the self-hosted server refuses blocks every remote write | P1 | M | None | DONE |

| [127](127-render-test-timeouts.md) | DX-02: heavy render tests fail at the 5 s harness default under load | P3 | S | None | DONE |

### Architecture deepening (phase 3, implemented from `.orchestrator/tasks/impl-20260918/ARCH-BRIEFS.md`)

DONE: ARCH-01, ARCH-02, ARCH-03, ARCH-04 (plus the core fix "a purged row is never restored"), ARCH-05. Not selected: ARCH-06.

ARCH-01 one home for the desktop profile search path (scripts copy still lacks Flatpak and macOS sandbox roots); ARCH-02 one active-filter chip builder (four desktop copies; ArchiveView still shows chips for criteria it does not apply); ARCH-03 import the time-estimate list from core (five hand-typed lists); ARCH-04 Rust project delete/restore in the shared parity fixture (three `purgedAt` differences); ARCH-05 task destination patch written four times; ARCH-06 stale-path fallback order and moved-folder list written three times.

### Direction (recorded for the owner, not built)

D1 "Restore project" from Trash brings its tasks back (needs a new synced field; after 112). D2 finish the partial translations now that the "partly translated" hint is gone (nl 28%, hi/ru 60%, pl/ar/pt/tr ~61%, it 66%, fr 81%). D3 one "where does this task live" rule in core (114 is the first step).

### Deferred (recorded, deliberately not planned this run)

- PERF-01 step 2: retire unused and prefix-covered indexes in core and Rust; needs `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` for the MCP `listTasks` sorts and a "full save of 10k tasks" perf row first.
- REL-03 twin: WebDAV 413/507 on attachment upload is a different seam. Mobile client-side validation failures only log and continue (no bounded seam). Owner decisions: soft-delete vs "keep the record, stop retrying" at the terminal step; a server-specific "file too large" toast (new key).
- Owner decisions from phase 1: compact mobile rows hide note/tags on the Reference list with no "Show details" control; a replayed Apple Reminders import counts as imported and deletes the reminder when only a tombstone exists (CP-3).
- Phase-1 closure leftovers: layout migration orphan-WAL double fault (N2); stale-lock live-removal race (C4b); editor attachment draft can drop a kept voice capture (R1); muted unapplied filter chips have no screen-reader cue; desktop row menus without arrow keys; Linux zbus notification connection never reset.
- Release rollout: no minimum time at a stage; shared concurrency groups can cancel a pending manual halt.
- Closure leftovers from phases 2-3: a device-local setting edited during a sync cycle is invisible to the change fingerprint (the AI endpoint and offline model path are restored explicitly; a general rule needs its own plan; mobile `applyDataToStore` not audited); `purgeDeletedTasks` / `purgeDeletedProjects` have no app caller left; Focus view shows no chip for a selection in a hidden category (needs a core hook change); email capture counts a replay as imported; the capture replay answer reveals whether an id exists to a capture token; core and Rust word the purged-restore refusal differently; narrowed Clear Trash text reads "1 tasks".
- Reliability "investigate" list: IMAP host change reuses the old password; synced calendar URLs cause blind GETs to LAN hosts; real Todoist export shapes; email-capture state lock after a panic.

### Considered and rejected (this run)

- Sharing the profile path list through `packages/core` (core must stay free of `fs`/`os`).
- Raw English store errors in toasts (realistic paths are blocked earlier or have a translated banner).
- Re-homing `quick-add-images` in the layout migration (old paths keep working because the folder did not move).
- ARCH-06 as "two TypeScript re-homing functions": there is one function with two callers.

## Review loop from v1.2.8 — September 16, 2026

Planned against `0b9ea1d0e` (integration branch `agent/integrate-20260916` = main `700c42184` + the 32 phase-1 review fixes). Phase-1 findings were fixed directly (see `.orchestrator/tasks/impl-20260916/LEDGER.md`, not tracked). This is the phase-2 improve set: every high-confidence, actionable finding from the product, reliability/security/tests and architecture audits became a plan; each plan is one commit. Root maintains status and integration.

| Plan | Finding | Priority | Effort | Dependencies | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [088](088-cli-stdout-and-governance-glob.md) | ARCH-01: CLI stdout log leak + unwired scripts tests | P2 | S | None | DONE |

| [092](092-desktop-lenient-json-prefix-guard.md) | REL-02: lenient parse adopts a nested fragment | P2 | S | None | DONE |
| [093](093-mcp-bootstrap-temp-rename.md) | REL-03: MCP bootstrap not atomic | P2 | S | None | DONE |
| [094](094-cloud-ready-probe-throttle.md) | REL-04: /ready fsync per unauthenticated hit | P2 | S | None | DONE |
| [095](095-core-store-write-contract-guard-test.md) | TEST-01: store write guard never fires in CI | P3 | S | None | DONE |
| [096](096-core-load-idempotence-matrix.md) | TEST-02: load(load(x)) covers 3 of 18 migrations | P2 | M | None | DONE |
| [097](097-mcp-exercise-tool-schemas.md) | TEST-03: MCP schemas never exercised | P3 | M | None | DONE |

| [099](099-local-api-lock-poison-recovery.md) | REL-05: poisoned write lock = 500s until restart | P2 | S | None | DONE |
| [100](100-mcp-logger-sanitizer.md) | SEC-03: MCP logger bypasses sanitizer | P3 | S | None | DONE |
| [101](101-desktop-inlist-add-keeps-text.md) | PROD-01: in-list add drops rejected capture text | P2 | S | None | DONE |
| [102](102-mind-sweep-honours-store-result.md) | PROD-02: Mind Sweep counts refused captures | P2 | S | None | DONE |
| [103](103-capture-rejections-visible.md) | PROD-03: silent capture rejections | P2 | S | None | DONE |
| [104](104-store-results-at-completion-and-star-sites.md) | PROD-04: six sites ignore the store result | P2 | M | None | DONE (partial: Pomodoro Mark-done still lacks undo/prompt) |
| [105](105-docs-remove-skip-occurrence.md) | PROD-05: docs promise a Skip occurrence action | P3 | S | None | DONE |
| [106](106-getting-started-deterministic-ids.md) | PROD-06: two devices seed two Getting Started projects | P2 | S | merge asymmetry below | BLOCKED |
| [107](107-desktop-editor-attachment-status.md) | PROD-07: desktop editor hides attachment state | P3 | S | None | DONE |
| [108](108-hardcoded-strings-existing-keys.md) | PROD-09: hardcoded English with existing keys | P3 | S | None | DONE |
| [109](109-sync-setup-parity.md) | PROD-10: self-hosted Test connection / blank token | P3 | S | None | DONE |
| [110](110-mobile-getting-started-guide-link.md) | PROD-11: mobile card lacks the guide link | P3 | S | None | DONE |

Blocked with evidence (needs a sync owner before it can ship): plan 106 was implemented and then withdrawn. With deterministic ids, a tombstone whose `deletedAt` precedes a newer live row's `createdAt` (device A deleted the tutorial, device B seeded it later) merges INCONSISTENTLY in `packages/core/src/sync.ts`: task tombstones at rev ≥ 2 beat the rev-1 live row (result is a hybrid: `deletedAt`/`rev` from the tombstone, `updatedAt` from the live row) while the project in the same merge comes back live — the user sees an empty Getting Started project on both devices. With `createdAt` before `deletedAt` (single-device history) both agree. Reproduction table: `.orchestrator/tasks/impl-20260916/result-p2-core.md` §8. Fixing the asymmetry is merge-engine work (ADR 0007 territory) and the next sync loop's first item; until then random seed ids stay (duplicate tutorial after pairing, harmless). Also recorded: `purge-expired-tombstones` reports itself applied even when it removed nothing (load-migration bookkeeping, harmless).

Follow-ups from the phase-2/3 closure reviews (recorded, not fixed): Pomodoro Mark-done reports failures but still has no undo toast / next-action prompt — needs a shared completion helper extracted from the row hooks (plan 104's stated Why, half delivered); the local API rejects seven cloud-writable project fields (`tagIds`, `taskSortBy`, `isFocused`, `supportNotes`, `dueDate`, `reviewAt`, `startDate`) — pinned as NOT_IMPLEMENTED by plan 098's parity test, owner decision whether to widen; the inline create-person failure reuses `task.addFailed` copy (a `people.addFailed` key is locale-frozen); plan 103's rejected desktop audio capture keeps the dialog open but does not retry the recording; plan 109's desktop self-hosted probe handler has no unit test; MCP `isoDateLikeSchema` is shape-only (`2026-13-45` passes; pinned in index.test.ts); `scripts/mindwtr-api.test.ts`'s readiness poll was widened to 30 s (unplanned test-only commit); the File Sync reader in sync.rs keeps its own forward scan (port the storage.rs prefix guard); an empty File Sync document now fails as "no recognised sync surface" (safe, wording misleading); `/ready` shares the feed's client-key rule so a proxied external monitor can be throttled when proxy headers are untrusted; the log sanitizer stringifies numeric/boolean context values.

Deferred (recorded, not planned): PROD-08 incubate question, PROD-12 Quick Add help tokens, the Dropbox-not-configured string, and the 65 `resolveText` keys with no English entry — all need locale edits, which were frozen this batch by a concurrent widget change; do them together once the tree is clean. ARCH-07 (44 unreferenced RN transitive deps) is MED confidence and lockfile-churning mid-RC. ARCH-08 quick-add token table and ARCH-09 settings descriptor are worth-exploring deepening candidates for a later loop. Architecture candidates selected for phase 3 (not plans): Focus derivation in core, WebDAV encryption-posture port, sort-roster unification. Direction notes (not planned): restore a hand-cancelled task to its previous status (needs a P18 field decision), a desktop "settle store action" helper (after plan 104 shows the sites).

Considered and rejected: attachment remote/local ports (L effort, data-loss class, outside an RC); Rust sync.rs/storage.rs split (pure moves, large churn); vitest config triplicate (guarded); load-migration cost (single-digit ms); `task-utils.ts` split (namespace, fails the deletion test); a mobile folder-probe for File Sync (needs design).

## Review loop from v1.2.8 — September 15, 2026

Planned against `51ac48c2f`. The comprehensive batch fixes archive-section retention, cloud attachment GC, revoked capture-token fallback, legacy capture-audio readability, project-title Escape, menu focus, and Shortcut diagnostic privacy; each remains its own implementation commit. The broad improve pass selects only the three supported opportunities below. Root maintains status and integration.

| Plan | Finding | Priority | Effort | Dependencies | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [085](085-bulk-date-accessible-names.md) | QUALITY-01: mobile bulk input accessible names | P2 | S | None | DONE |
| [086](086-bulk-area-custom-order.md) | QUALITY-02: desktop bulk area custom order | P3 | S | None | DONE |
| [087](087-archive-reactivation-validation.md) | PERF-01: remove per-task archived-section projections | P2 | M | None | DONE |

Plans 085/086 can execute independently from 087. Plan087 is the sole Strong architecture candidate: deepen existing container validation with scoped restoration eligibility, remove repeated projected arrays, preserve the later durable transition. No new generic cache or schema is selected.

Considered and rejected: another widget chooser/fallback rewrite (native Tasks and Compact intentionally differ); generalized bulk-form controllers (working save/session guards); public widget-copy expansion without a concrete misleading instruction; new roadmap features; native-queue or snapshot-sync rewrites without evidence reopening existing ADRs. Fresh dependency audit reproduces the existing image-size Metro build-time deferral with no listed patched release; quick-xml/rkyv parent constraints remain recorded below. No public-doc plan selected. Native accessibility and platform latency require separate device evidence; host tests do not establish those outcomes.


Written by the 2026-08-13 improve audit (Phase 2 of the review-improve loop), stamped against `0e4021faa`. Selection was non-interactive: every high-confidence actionable finding became a plan; speculative/deferred items are recorded below instead of planned.

## Execution order and status

| # | Plan | Findings | Effort | Status |
|---|------|----------|--------|--------|
| 001 | tauri-main-thread-commands | R-01, R-02 | S-M | DONE |

| 017 | adr-encryption-at-rest | DOCS-01 | S | DONE |
| 018 | mobile-store-action-settlement | ARCH-01 | M | DONE |

Dependencies: 015 before 016 (both touch lint wiring; 015 is upstream in CI). 001's commit 2 depends on its commit 1. 006 commit 2 depends on commit 1 only for merge cleanliness. Everything else independent.

## Deferred (recorded, deliberately not planned)

- **DEPS-01** desktop `file:` → `workspace:*` core dependency (138MB stale copy): defer until just after 1.2.0 stable — lockfile churn mid-RC-train is the hazard, not the change.
- **DEPS-02** Expo SDK 54→57 migration: own release train post-stable, staged 54→55→56→57 with per-hop device rounds and patch re-validation; the `@fugood/react-native-audio-pcm-stream` New-Architecture question decides whether realtime transcription needs a new transport first.
- **DEBT-03** attachment-backend 2×5 glue duplication: investigation verdict only — lifecycle + wire protocol already shared; diff WebDAV+Dropbox bodies before believing consolidation pays. Do not re-audit without that diff.
- **DIR-03** publish the CLI (bin in mindwtr-mcp) vs. relabel docs as contributor script: maintainer product decision; both halves cheap once decided.
- **DIR-04** web/PWA storage decision: spike (measure serialized 5k-task fixture vs localStorage quota) decides invest (IndexedDB adapter behind setStorageAdapter) vs demote (docs). Product call after the measurement.
- **DIR-05** Obsidian on mobile: real parity hole, deliberately not now (SAF two-way writer risk). Recorded to stop re-derivation.

## Considered and rejected

- zustand v5 / lucide 1.x bumps: ride-along only, no standalone value.
- Re-export shim deletion (attachment-utils, dropbox-sync pair): churn > value.
- Rust storage.rs/sync.rs "god module" split: production halves are ~3k lines; tests inflate the counts.
- native-schema job off macOS: needs xcrun swiftc, verified.
- testing-strategy.md command additions: 6-locale parity cost for info one click away.
- MCP/cloud auth helper sharing: deliberate workspace independence, recorded in file headers.
- Global Android user-CA trust: deliberately restores OS trust-store parity for arbitrary self-hosted URLs; scoping it requires a separate native HTTP stack, and the device owner or administrator must explicitly install the CA. The low-leverage L/HIGH-risk migration is rejected unless the product threat model changes.
- Mobile task-field renderer mega-interface: real coupling, but current performance gates are green and the refactor crosses keyboard, recurrence, attachment, audio, and progressive-disclosure behavior. Keep as Worth exploring until a measured regression or a narrower slice justifies it.

## Legacy plans (2026-08-09 files, reconciled 2026-08-13)

`2026-08-09-improve-product.md` and `2026-08-09-improve-architecture-performance.md` predate this run (base faea7edc3):
- Persistence-failure surface with retry — **DONE** (645f376d7, PersistenceFailureBanner both platforms).
- Watcher partial-failure lifecycle — **DONE** (watcher controller/generation commits + this loop's S6/S11/C2).
- Localize desktop Settings feedback — **LARGELY DONE** (4b8c53a4c, 43fc66552, 06eb36bc9, 24ac122f2); the ratchet-test remainder is superseded by plan 009.
- Mobile onboarding busy-guard — **LIKELY DONE** (8aad219ff); verify before re-planning.
- SQLite warm-open cost, TS/Rust golden merge fixtures, exact transfer-operation IDs, mobile Data-row a11y — **STILL OPEN**, carried as future candidates (not selected this run; the first two are M-L with high care requirements, the latter two are UX polish batches).

# 2026-08-22 improve audit (Phase 2 of the review-improve loop), stamped against `b0a96ccc9`

Selection non-interactive: every HIGH-confidence actionable finding became a plan; numbering continues from the 08-13 run. All 08-13 plans remain DONE. Executors: one commit per finding, red test first, honor STOP conditions, update this table.

## Execution order & status

Dependency notes: 031 after 024 (shared vi.mock idiom for un-stubbing); 032's DX-01 (lockfile) lands as an isolated commit before other work touches node_modules; 024 items 1→5→8→9 are ordered internally.

## Phase 2 plans — review-improve loop 2026-09-04 (stamped against `992113e77`)

Selection was automatic: every HIGH-confidence actionable finding from the Phase 2 improve audit (`.orchestrator/tasks/review-loop-20260904/improve-*.md`, git-excluded working state) became a plan; direction items are recorded below, not built.

| # | Plan | Findings | Effort | Status |

Fixed directly during the loop without a plan (see the loop ledger): BUG-R1 mobile attachment timers (c9541342e) and the thirty Phase 1 findings.

Architecture deepening (Phase 3, from the architecture audit): DEBT-01 editor field rosters → core (Strong), DEBT-04 widget builders on the Focus sequential rule (Strong), DEBT-02 auto-sync pacing controller → core (Strong), DEBT-03 device-local cache rules → core, lazy version (Worth exploring, accepted: two real adapters and one recorded drift), DEBT-06 task-list sort rosters → core (Worth exploring, accepted: "FOUR allowlists" trap). DEBT-05 (dev-runtime gate helper: store.ts enforces when `process` is undefined, i.e. desktop production THROWS on a write-contract violation while mobile repairs silently) is a maintainer polarity decision → deferred, recorded here. DX-05 (roster parity gate) is superseded by DEBT-01/06.

### Direction (recorded, not built)
- **DIR-01** expandable projects in the desktop sidebar (promised on #1116): `buildProjectGroups` and `getProjectNextActionState` already exist; device-local expand state can follow `HIDDEN_SIDEBAR_VIEWS_STORAGE_KEY`. Needs a design spike (default collapsed state, area nesting, badges). Desktop first.
- **DIR-02** widen the shared review contract from step order to step content (bucket key + cap per step from `buildReviewSteps`) so both Daily Review modals read truncation and the focus limit from core. Medium; narrows divergence, cannot dedupe JSX.
- **DIR-03** one quick-add token registry (token + label key + gating flag) feeding the help sentence and the editor badges; spike the assembled-sentence grammar in zh/ja/fa/sv first.
- **Investigate**: Daily Review step order is re-listed per platform (`DailyReviewModal.tsx` ~:199-214, mobile sibling) and consulted from core only through `hasWork`; add a contract test before it diverges.

### Deferred (this run)
- **DEPS-R1** quick-xml 0.39.4 (RUSTSEC-2026-0194/0195) and rkyv 0.7.46 (RUSTSEC-2026-0235): `cargo update --precise` refuses both (wayland-scanner/ashpd/rfd/tauri-plugin-dialog pin quick-xml ^0.39; rust_decimal/byte-unit/tauri-plugin-log pin rkyv 0.7). Wait for the parents; a `[patch.crates-io]` override is not worth the risk for build-time XML and an unreached deserializer.
- **DEPS-R2** image-size (Metro build-time transitive, no fixed release): monitor.
- **B12** ~75 call-site keys still missing from en.ts (Obsidian view 38, People manager, Saved filters, Pomodoro phases, mobile context-automation): allowlisted shrink-only in `apps/desktop/src/test/i18n-missing-keys.test.ts` and `apps/mobile/tests/i18n-missing-keys.test.ts`; ~375-525 translations = own task.
- `formatFocusTaskLimitText`'s literal-`3` fallback (`packages/core/src/focus-utils.ts:12-18`) is dead now that every locale carries `{{count}}` (guarded); delete with its test in a follow-up.

## Plans 035–066 (2026-08-26..31 loop, reconciled 2026-09-04)

All executed in the 1.2.5-rc → 1.2.6 window; each plan file records its own outcome and index rows were never added at the time. Treat every one of 035–066 as DONE unless its file says otherwise.

## Deferred (recorded, deliberately not planned this run)

- **DEPS-03** ~50 RN transitives pinned as direct root dependencies (from 7703fdee2, none imported by root code): removal is mechanical but requires a lockfile review + real Android build round — own maintenance window, alongside DEPS-02 (Expo 54→57).
- **SEC-15b** any-token-mode IP rate limiting + true-LRU eviction on the cloud limiter: real but opt-in mode; an IP bucket changes behavior for proxied deployments — needs a deployment-model decision.
- **SEC-12b** moving WebDAV URL userinfo into the keyring at config-save: real, M effort, follow-up to 026's redaction.
- **SEC-10b** Android network-security-config domain scoping: REJECTED as planned — conflicts with settled #663 (base-config cleartext is load-bearing for arbitrary private-IP WebDAV); the JS-level `assertConnectionAllowed` guard (026) is the enforcement point.
- **DIR-02** spreadsheet round-trip apply mode: DECIDED "no" this run — docs stance (skip on id match) stands; 033/DOCS-05 aligns the code comments. Revisit only with a rev-aware design.
- **DIR-03** backup ZIP with attachment bytes: needs a mobile memory/threading measurement spike; DOCS-01 (033) captures the safety value now.
- **BUG-26 caveat** — if investigation shows SyncRun re-checks freshness, 024 item 7 downgrades to early-abort only.
- **DEBT-01** (AppTheme descriptor registry) and **DEBT-02** (sync-configuration transaction consolidation): routed to the architecture-deepening phase, not this plan set.
- **DX-02** worktree pool: `git worktree prune` done operationally; deleting the 21 checkout dirs (53 GB) left to the maintainer (destructive).

## Findings considered and rejected (this run)

- MCP task-content-as-instructions sanitizer: inherent to a task-reading tool; client-side concern.
- MCP auth-throttle FIFO eviction: bounded impact (401→429 only); comment-worthy at most.
- window_state.rs non-atomic layout write: loss is monitor geometry; not scheduled.
- `insertColumns` dead cache in queries.ts: one-line deletion, fold into any 027 commit touching the file.
- Wholesale task-utils.ts split; big React-surface splits; SETTINGS_X_VALUES helper; wiki/Home.md link parity; CI caching: all re-confirmed not worth doing (see 08-13 rationale).
- allTokens memoization (ListView.tsx:292): consumers re-render regardless; buys nothing.


## 2026-09-07 improve audit (v1.2.7 review loop)

Planned against `77137ce0d` / `a68aeeb6f`. All reviews use GPT-6 Astra; implementation is delegated to GPT-5.6 Sol, with root handling ordinary docs. Selection is automatic under the review-improve-loop: all five exact-evidence findings are selected. Each finding gets one scoped implementation commit per repository. Prior plans and deferred decisions remain as recorded above.

| # | Plan | Priority | Effort | Status |
|---|------|----------|--------|--------|
| 077 | sqlite-final-tombstone-expiry | P2 | M | DONE |
| 078 | cloud-focus-write-parity | P2 | M | DONE |
| 079 | mcp-auth-throttle-docs | P3 | S | DONE (app README and all six public locales; web check passed) |
| 080 | inbox-project-reuse-eligibility | P2 | S | DONE |
| 081 | dialog-autofocus-return | P2 | S | DONE |

No logical dependencies; isolated implementations may run in parallel. Diagnostics ledger and field-test additions are integrated by root, preserving all entries. Public docs plan079 also receives one scoped mindwtr-web commit.

Considered and rejected: no fresh evidence reopens the snapshot-sync ADRs, MCP per-process multi-database state (one configured database is the supported host), cloud revision ceiling without a production trigger, or a suspected calendar duplicate-submit path without reproduction. Existing image-size/quick-xml/rkyv advisory deferrals remain; fresh shipped npm lock audits are clean except the exact documented Metro chain. No additional dependency or CI restructuring plan is warranted. No new roadmap feature was selected.


### Architecture deepening, 2026-09-07

| # | Plan | Priority | Effort | Status |
|---|------|----------|--------|--------|
| 082 | webdav-presence-proof | P2 | M | DONE |

Strong and automatically selected: both WebDAV adapters can stamp an unknown remote result as a completed daily proof. Replace their duplicated decision with the existing core attachment-presence module. Keep each platform's local-prepass, cancellation, cooldown and activation behavior. No dependencies on077–081. The timestamped HTML report is a temporary review artifact; plan082 is the durable Spec.

Rejected after current-body comparison: whole attachment-backend consolidation and deletion of existing Cloud/Dropbox adapters widen interfaces without removing domain decisions; sync configuration transactions already have a deep module; notification polling and native alarm scheduling remain distinct adapters; editor mega-interface and Daily Review direction remain unselected.


## 2026-09-09 improve and architecture audit (v1.2.8 review loop)

Selected against `57b257812`: product and integrity broad audits found no additional supported defects after comprehensive remediation. The architecture/performance audit reproduced one calendar-specific N+1 storage path. User selection is automatic under review-improve-loop; all reviews use Astra, implementation uses Sol.

| # | Plan | Priority | Effort | Status |
|---|------|----------|--------|--------|
| 083 | calendar-push-mapping-inventory | P2 | S-M | DONE |

Plan083 is both PERF-01 and the sole Strong architecture candidate; one implementation commit. No dependencies. Rejected: another shared UI draft lifecycle and another visibility controller would move platform lifetime decisions into wider interfaces without a reproduced remaining defect. Prior ADR/roadmap/dependency deferrals stay unchanged. A source comment suggests checking cancellation-alert presentation on iOS pageSheet during a device round; no current runtime evidence establishes a defect, so no implementation plan was created.

## 2026-09-12 improve and architecture audit

Reviewed against `43f40c2ea`, including explicit MCP validation, transports, durable writes, startup and packaged-client setup. Correctness/security/test coverage findings from the comprehensive pass are remediated separately; docs corrections cover package setup and stale engineering claims. The broad audit adds one supported performance/deepening candidate. All reviews use GPT-6 Astra xhigh; implementations use GPT-5.6 Sol or the leader. Automatic selection is authorized by the review-improve loop.

| # | Plan | Priority | Effort | Status |
|---|------|----------|--------|--------|
| 084 | widget-publication-derivation | P2 | M | DONE |

Plan084 is the sole new Strong architecture candidate and one finding/commit. No dependencies. Shared native-command persistence recovery also deepens an existing duplicated rule, already handled in comprehensive remediation; it is not a second refactor plan. The complete selected plan set is committed before phase-two implementation.

Considered and rejected: whole native-queue unification, combining widget/Shortcuts caches, optional-capability wrapper consolidation, splitting native modules solely by size, new architecture registries, repeated UI lifecycle mega-interfaces, snapshot/CRDT migrations and roadmap expansion. Native CI already compiles app Kotlin and runs widget/Watch Swift package tests; missing local Swift is a validation limit, not a new tooling defect. Prior dependency migration/advisory decisions remain unless a fresh shipped-path audit supplies new evidence. No new DX or product-direction plan is selected.
