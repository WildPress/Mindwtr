/**
 * The one home for the "Today" list the widget payload builders render:
 * `apps/mobile/lib/widget-data.ts` (Android widget, iOS widget, and the
 * Shortcuts snapshot's "focus" list, #980) and
 * `apps/desktop/src/lib/macos-widget-data.ts` (the macOS WidgetKit widget,
 * #1054). Both used to carry their own copy of this selection, and the copies
 * picked a sequential project's one slot with the order-only
 * `getSequentialFirstTaskIds` while the Focus screens picked it with the
 * schedule-ranked `getFocusSequentialFirstTaskIds` -- so a project whose
 * step 3 was due today showed step 3 in Focus and step 1 on the widget.
 *
 * Focus order is ONE contract across surfaces (#1090): this module applies the
 * Focus screens' rule, and the builders keep only their payload shaping (which
 * needs `react-native-android-widget` / AsyncStorage on mobile and neither on
 * desktop, hence no shared builder).
 *
 * `now` is a parameter, never `Date.now()`, so the selection is deterministic
 * in tests and one payload build sees one instant.

 *
 * 1. The Today pool is not narrowed to today's starts. The widget has no
 *    Upcoming section, so a task that is due today but deferred to a later day
 *    would simply vanish; on the screens it moves to Upcoming instead.
 * 2. A queued star stays out until its start day, even if the task is due sooner.
 * 3. Review Due rejoins the one list, next actions only and minus the steps the
 *    sequential gate holds back. The screens split a next action that is also
 *    due for review into its own section; here that would drop it from the
 *    widget altogether. Waiting and someday tasks stay out, as they always have.
