/**
 * Exact-retry bookkeeping for native host writes, shared by every contract write
 * that takes a `requestId`. One request runs its write at most once:
 *
 * - The first call for a request ID reserves it before anything is awaited; a
 *   concurrent call with the same ID and payload waits for that same run.
 * - A later call with the same ID and payload does not write again. It only
 *   finishes the save if the first call's save failed, then returns the first
 *   call's result.
 * - A call with the same ID and another payload is refused (INVALID_INPUT).
 * - A write whose save has not succeeded is never forgotten, so its retry can
 *   always finish it. Only saved requests are evicted to stay under `limit`;
 *   while the bound holds only unsaved requests, new requests are refused
 *   (ACTION_FAILED) until a retry saves them.
 *
 * - A write that landed in memory while its save failed returns SAVE_FAILED
 *   (with settleWrite). It keeps its receipt as an owed save: a retry only
 *   saves, and never runs the write again. A write returns SAVE_FAILED only
 *   when its change landed (runStoreWrite decides).
 *
 * Any other failure means the write did not land: it leaves no receipt, so the
 * same request can run again.
 *
 * Receipts live in memory. They cover the window in which a save is owed. After
 * a durable acknowledgment, a restart or an eviction, a replay runs the write
 * again, so every write must be target-state: a replay of a request that already
 * landed writes nothing.
