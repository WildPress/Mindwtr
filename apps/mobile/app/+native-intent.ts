    //   Router also visit /capture opens a blank quick-capture sheet behind it, which reappears after closing.
    //   Invalid capture payloads also belong to that hook's error handling.

    //   launch. The root capture modal is purpose-built for system entry points and works on both cold and warm
    //   launches. origin=system lets the modal send the app back behind the previous screen after the capture
    //   ends (#1169); in-app openers never set it.
